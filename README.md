## CPP Notebook

The purpose of this repo is testing creating C++ functions that are called with ctypes using a Jupyter notebook and Python kernel, along with the clang Jupyter kernel for developing the C++ library.

This is primarily to teach myself how to build a performant Python libary written in C++, and save my knowledge as I go so I can share it using modern REPL techniques, there aren't great modern learning methods for C++ and it's still thought of as a difficult and unsafe language, despite making great strides in the last decade.
