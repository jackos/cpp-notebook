## CPP Notebook

The purpose of this repo is testing creating C++ functions that are called with ctypes using a Jupyter notebook and Python kernel, while also using the clang Jupyter kernel while developing the C++ library.

This is for the purpose of learning how to build a performant Python libary written in C++, and saving my knowledge as I go so I can share it using modern REPL techniques, there aren't great modern learning methods for C++ as there are for Python.
